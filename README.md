# System-on-Chip (SoC) Design Journey  

Welcome to my repository showcasing my journey through **System-on-Chip (SoC) Design**! ðŸš€  

This repository contains resources, projects, and insights gained during an intensive course on SoC design. It includes work on processors, peripherals, and FPGA implementation. Below is an overview of the topics covered and the skills developed.  

## Agenda  
This repository reflects the structured learning process leading to the creation of a fully functional **RISC-V SoC**.  

1. **Introduction**  
   - Overview of SoC concepts and importance.  

2. **Processors**  
   - Understanding processor architecture and execution of machine code.  
   - Focus on the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).  

3. **Software, Compiler, and Linker**  
   - Working with compilers and linker scripts.  
   - Using makefiles to streamline development.  

4. **Building a Simple SoC**  
   - Step-by-step implementation of a basic SoC architecture.  

5. **Adding Peripherals**  
   - Integrating peripherals like GPIO and creating register maps.  

6. **Advanced IP Design**  
   - Accelerated learning on designing and optimizing custom IPs for SoC.  

7. **UART IP Core**  
   - Designing and implementing a UART transmitter module.  

8. **FPGA Emulation**  
   - Mapping SoC designs to an FPGA for real-world emulation and testing.  

## What I Learned  

- **Core Principles of Complex Chips**: How processors execute machine code at a low level.  
- **RISC-V ISA**: Gaining an in-depth understanding of this popular, open-source instruction set.  
- **Software Toolchain**: Compilers, linker scripts, and makefiles for efficient SoC development.  
- **Peripheral Integration**: Register maps and interfacing with external hardware.  
- **FPGA Flow**: Basics of FPGA design and practical emulation.  

## Final Project  

The culmination of this journey was the design and implementation of a fully functional **System-on-Chip** featuring:  
- A **GPIO module** for general-purpose I/O.  
- A **UART transmitter** for communication.  

The project was developed, simulated, and successfully emulated on an FPGA board.
